/**
 A CardValidationResult is an `OptionSetType`. This means, it can be 
 combined with other CardValidationResult. This allows to have multiple 
 validation results in a single object, like having a card number that 
 does not match the card type and an expired card at the same time.
 
 **Example:**
 ````
 let result = CardValidationResult.NumberDoesNotMatchType.union(CardValidationResult.CardExpired)
