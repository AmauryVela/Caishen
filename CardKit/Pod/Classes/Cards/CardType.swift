     Card types are typically identified by their first n digits. In compliance to ISO/IEC 7812, the first digit is the *Major industry identifier*, which is equal to:
        - 1, 2 for airlines
        - 3 for Travel & Entertainment (non-banks like American Express, DinersClub, ...)
        - 4, 5 for banking and financial institutions
        - 6 for merchandising and banking/financial (Discover Card, Laser, China UnionPay, ...)
        - 7 for petroleum and other future industry assignments
        - 8 for healthcare, telecommunications and other future industry assignments
        - 9 for assignment by national standards bodies
     The first 6 digits also are the *Issuer Identification Number*, indicating the issuer of the card. 
     
     In order to identify the card issuer, this function returns a Set of integers which indicate the card issuer. In case of Discover for example, this is the set of [(644...649),(622126...622925),(6011)], which contains different IIN ranges which are reserved for Discover.
     
     - returns: A set of numbers which, when being found in the first digits of the card number, indicate the card issuer.
